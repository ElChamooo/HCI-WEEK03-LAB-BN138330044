        <p class="paragraph">Java is one of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea (a part of the Pacific Ocean)
             to the north. With a population of 156.9 million people (including Madura) in mid 2024, projected to rise to 158 million at mid 2025, Java is the world's most populous
              island, home to approximately 56% of the Indonesian population while constituting only 7% of its land area. Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's 
              northwestern coast.</p><hr>
        <p class="paragraph">Many of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates,
             and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia
              politically, economically, and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, 
              Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.</p><hr>
        <p class="paragraph">Java was formed by volcanic eruptions due to geologic subduction of the Australian Plate under the Sunda Plate. It is the 13th largest island in the
             world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass, at about 132,598.77 square kilometres (51,196.67 sq mi) (including Madura's 5,408.45 square kilometres
              (2,088.21 sq mi)). A chain of volcanic mountains is the east-west spine of the island.</p><hr>
